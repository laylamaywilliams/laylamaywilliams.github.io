        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wfg-FbHiL._SY466_.jpg" alt="Book Cover: Shuggie Bain" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;max-width:150px;height:auto">
<p>Douglas Stuart’s ‘Shuggie Bain’ follows the childhood of a young boy, Shuggie, and the struggles he faced growing up in a working class background of 1980s Scotland. Despite his desperate attempts to fit in and behave like a ‘real boy’, his homosexuality is apparent leading to bullying and his own insecurity. His mother, Agnes, is an alcoholic, abandoned by almost everyone in her life, from her husband to her eldest children. Yet, Shuggie withstands her temperamental personality and unreliable mothering attributes, despite his own happiness and security. It is a story of loss, hardship and the acceptance of one’s identity. It is a story of a young boy that is forced to grow up too quickly.</p>
<p>This was perhaps one of the most perceptive portrayals of alcoholism I have ever seen in literature. Throughout the novel, Stuart evokes both sympathy and anger from the reader towards the despairing state of Shuggie’s life. The reader may hold their breath in hope that Agnes’ situation will improve whilst constantly knowing that her life is ultimately hopeless. Stuart conveys the relentless ups and downs as Agnes fights for sobriety and as Shuggie watches helplessly. Whilst the novel is primarily aimed at those who can relate to the characters, particularly in terms of the key themes of addiction, poverty and sexuality, the book is still relevant to anyone willing to widen their breadth of reading and understand the hardships faced by many. The novel is, in part, autobiographical, and I think that really comes across in the insightful portrayal of 1980s poverty. It is beautifully written and carefully captures the essence of one individual’s life.</p>
<p>One of my favourite moments was the protagonist’s description of his mother and how ‘when her belly was empty and her weans were hungry, she did her hair and let the world think otherwise’. This is one of the few examples in the novel where Agnes did right by Shuggie. I think the admiring tone created conveys the idea that it only takes small, infrequent positive moments to reinforce one's love for their family. It is also a reminder to any reader to take pride in oneself and keep their head held high. In a way, this small moment of support has an undertone of melancholy as Shuggie sees his mother’s love for him but knows that once she begins to drift into a drunken state, she will no longer be her proud self.</p>
<p>I would easily recommend this book and therefore give it four stars. I cannot wait to read Stuart’s most recent book ‘Young Mungo’.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="https://greatleapforward.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/War-Horse.jpg" alt="War Horse" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;max-width:150px;height:auto">
<p>On the 11th of June 2025, I saw the National Theatre’s ‘War Horse’ for the second time. Adapted for the stage by Nick Strafford, ‘War Horse’ is a compelling story of a boy’s love for his horse set against the devastating backdrop of World War One.</p>
<p>What makes ‘War Horse’ a play unlike any other, is their spectacular use of puppetry. Designed by the Handspring Puppet Company, Joey and Topthorn, the leading horses, come alive on stage. This is, in large, due to the incredible actors in control of the puppets. Each horse is controlled by a group of three actors who work together to create the horse’s character. The detail and concentration that goes into controlling these horses is unimaginable. From the changes in breath to the subtle stamp of a hoof or flick of a tail, the horses become alive in every way. I frequently had to remind myself that they were not real horses! Another way in which the puppets become alive is through the actors' interactions with them, both puppeteers and characters. By simply looking at the puppet, the actor commandeering the head of the horse drew the audience’s attention to the horses encouraging them to focus on the animal rather than the actor. Furthermore, the character’s interactions with the horses evoke a range of emotions from the audience depending on their relationship with the horse. Consequently, ‘War Horse’ is an original, immersive experience that I would see time and time again.</p>
<p>The fixed set of ‘War Horse’ consists of a projection screen designed to look like a torn piece of parchment. Throughout the play, this screen is used to project both heart-warming and heart-breaking images. For instance, when the audience sees Albert’s and Joey’s relationship begin to flourish, time is made prominent through the sketches of the passing seasons. This alongside the singer’s incredible voice and the emotive music creates a beautiful, aesthetically appealing scene. Another use of projection that stood out to me was a moment in which blood turned into poppies after the death of many of Albert’s squad in Act Two. This imaginative reminder of those lost to the war brought tears to the eyes of all those watching.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the show would not be what it is without the incredible backstage crew. Having been lucky enough to gain insight to what goes on backstage, I was made aware of the fast-paced, precise happenings that ensure each performance is at its best. The process of props being taken from and handed to the actors at the moments required was methodical and rapid. Watching the play from beneath the stage with the follow-spot crew or from behind the curtains with the stage manager heightened my appreciation for the show as a whole.</p>
<p>It would not be fair to write this review without mentioning the remarkable cast. This talented group of people are what make ‘War Horse’ a magical and unique performance. They are the force that immerse the audience into the world of Albert and Joey, take us back to the early 20th century and create a truly breathtaking experience.</p>
<p>The National Theatre’s ‘War Horse’ is certainly a five star show. I cannot wait to see it again.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812nGlXCWwL.jpg" alt="Book Cover: The Belljar" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;max-width:150px;height:auto">
<p>Written just months before her suicide, Plath’s ‘The Bell Jar’ tells the story of ambitious student Esther Greenwood as her dreams of becoming a poet are put on hold due to a mental health crisis. Plath’s writing is clear, impactful and full of heart wrenching experiences. Plath entwines ambition, dissociation between mind and body and womanhood to create a compelling tale of real experiences.</p>
<p>One of my favourite moments of the novel is Plath’s description of the fig tree. Arguably, she uses this as a metaphor for the abundance of choices people can experience in life and how this can often lead to overwhelm. I think what Plath is trying to suggest is that the combination of ambition and a lack of direction can often lead to feelings of helplessness and anxiety. As a character who has worked relentlessly all of her life, Esther consequently suffers from having to choose between a number of ‘wonderful future[s]’ but is incapable of choosing just one ‘fig’. After some research, I discovered that ‘the green fig tree’ is possibly an allusion to a biblical story. In this story, Jesus and his disciples come across a fig tree that had many green leaves. However, upon drawing closer, the tree only had leaves and no fruit. Perhaps this suggests that, deep down, the character of Esther knows that none of these future possibilities will be fulfilled. Consequently, Esther’s fear of making the right decision overrides a fear of not making a decision at all, leaving her stranded and ‘starving to death’.</p>
<p>What I loved most about ‘The Bell Jar’ was Plath’s prose style. She uses rich figurative language and her writing is full of expertly crafted metaphors. This is ultimately what makes the novel engaging, sorrowful and cathartic. Although it is a difficult read, I was immersed in the world Plath creates and hence, I would give it five stars. Everyone should read this.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<img]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="https://abc.nl/covers/9780316769488/200" alt="Book Cover: The Catcher in the Rye" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px;max-width:150px;height:auto">
<p>J.D Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye' covers a timeline of just over two days and follows the journey of a teenage boy, expelled from boarding school, as he makes his way home. Throughout the novella, we see his interactions with various characters, both the 'phonies' and those he loves. Whilst it is largely considered a modern classic, the mixed reviews came as a shock to me.</p>
<p>Many believe that the protagonist, Holden, is a selfish, spoilt malcontent and that the novella's language is limited. Personally, I would argue that the language in the novel is chosen carefully to enhance the character voice and give the reader a true insight to the mind of a troubled teen. As for Holden himself, whilst I'll admit he is not the most likeable, his hardships in life, such as losing his brother at just thirteen, should not be ignored. I think that people are often inadvertently dismissive of the character's that they do not immediately relate to or those that are flawed. However, this should not be a cause for coming to the conclusion that the novella is poorly written. I believe that Salinger carefully captures the imperfect workings of Holden's mind creating a slow, but ultimately heart-warming story.</p>
<p>Holden should be a sympathetic character. He alienates himself from his peers and views the majority of adults in his life as 'phony'. Whilst his attitude is evidently judgemental, arguably, it is the character's way of avoiding failure or emotional pain. Another way in which Salinger portrays Holden as a sympathetic is through his repetitive allusions to suicide. By writing these comments in a casual way, Salinger explores the fine line between teenage angst and serious depression. For me and likely many other readers, Holden's dissatisfaction with life is initially difficult to comprehend; he comes from a wealthy family, has a loving sister and has every opportunity within his reach. Yet, as the story proceeds, the depth of Holden's unhappiness becomes apparent as his emotions become evidently more troubling than those of the average adolescent. Maybe, it is not a matter of 'why' the character should feel this way, but rather a reflection of those emotions in general.</p>
<p>My favourite parts of his story are those depicted with his younger sister, Phoebe. It is because of his perceptive sister that Holden eventually begins to take responsibility for his life and actions towards the end of the novel. I also believe that these interactions remind us, as readers that, despite Holden's tough facade, he is still just a child. His misinterpretation of Robert Burns' 'Comin' Thro the Rye' perhaps acts as a metaphor for Holden's discomfort with growing up and reaching adulthood, further conveying his childish nature. I think it is interesting that Salinger chose to use this poem since its predominant theme is the question of whether or not casual sex is okay. One could interpret that this decision links to the protagonist's internal struggle surrounding sex and women.</p>
<p>As for those who think the novella is lacking in plot, I believe they are missing the point. It is not meant to be an action packed story. I would interpret that Salinger aimed to highlight the importance of both friends, family and strangers in shaping an individuals life. Each character Holden meets, even in this short period of time, influences the decisions he makes and eventually, as mentioned before, his decision to work out what he wants to do with his life. This idea actually made me think of 'Station Eleven' by Emily St. John Mandel when one of the characters reflects, moments before her death, on how different life would be if a single person, even a stranger, was not in it.</p>
<p>Overall, I would give this book three stars. Whilst there is depth to the novella and its protagonist, personally, it wasn't my favourite modern classic. I can see its literary value but I simply did not enjoy it enough to give it five stars. That being said, I would still encourage you to read it if you haven't already and to let me know what you thought!</p>]]></content>
