With live music and a soundtrack from the 1980\u2019s, the play is modernised yet still in keeping with Shakespeare\u2019s original.

A stand out performance, however, would be that of Freyja Madsen as the hilarious Malvolio who undergoes a dramatic transformation from a stiff embodiment of propriety to a ridiculous, almost pitiful personification of the power of self-delusion.

As the character of Viola puts it, only \u2018time\u2019 can \u2018untangle\u2019 the complex series of events leading to the play\u2019s satisfying ending. We see this with the arrival of Viola\u2019s twin brother, Sebastian, played by the talented young actor, Joe Lamb. The dramatic irony in the final scenes, as Sebastian is comically attacked by Sir Andrew and Viola appears to be suddenly married to Olivia, is heightened by the actors\u2019 brilliant facial expressions and consistently misguided actions."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"\u2018Twelfth Night\u2019 by the Oxford Theatre Guild is therefore not an evening to miss.
