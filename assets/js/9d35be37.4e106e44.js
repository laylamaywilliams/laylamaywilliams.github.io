Set roughly twenty years after Nigeria gained independence from British colonialism in 1960, Adichie explores the effects of colonialism, civil war and a shift in religious beliefs within a single family. She depicts the family\u2019s struggle for a modern identity against the backdrop of a devastating military coup."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"The novel\u2019s narrator, Kambili Achike, is the fifteen year old daughter of the wealthy factory owner and devout Catholic, Eugene Achike. Adichie uses their relationship to demonstrate the mental manipulation of domestic abuse. For example, in Chapter One, Kambili describes the \u2018love-sips\u2019 her father would offer her and her brother, Jaja, when he drinks his tea. The scolding tea consequently becomes a symbol, in Kambili\u2019s eyes, of Papa\u2019s love for his children. Moreover, it acts as a symbol for Eugene\u2019s abusive nature. Eugene and the tea are both supposed to be \u2018good\u2019 for Kambili, even if they hurt her physically. Metaphorically, it is also reflective of their relationship as, despite being harmed, Kambili idolises her father and continues to seek his love and approval. However, as the book progresses, Kambili is shown other, happier ways of living, previously unknown to her, as she and Jaja go to stay with Aunty Ifeoma. Ifeoma and her children show Jaja and Kambili the joys of family, laughter and mental freedom. Whilst Kambili is still tied by her father, she begins to feel more independent and rebellious. This arguably acts as a narrative catalyst for the subsequent events of the novel."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"The novel also focuses on religion and how, when interpreted incorrectly, can be the cause for abuse and control. Throughout the novel, Adichie highlights how Papa believes the harm he inflicts on his family is for their own good. He persistently asks his children why they sin as if he believes he has no other choice but to punish them. Papa\u2019s beliefs are molded by Catholic missionaries and are incredibly strict. In this way, Adichie demonstrates one of many effects of colonialism in that Papa\u2019s religious beliefs have been Westernised yet his interpretation of the Bible is too strict and literal."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Finally, one of Adichie\u2019s most impactful arguments is perhaps her insistence that Nigeria is in need of a chance to rule itself. In Chapter Seventeen, Adichie uses the character of Aunty Ifeoma to describe how \u2018there are people [...] who think that [Nigeria] cannot rule [itself] because the few times we tried, we failed\u2019. She states that it is \u2018like telling a crawling baby who tries to walk, and then falls back on his buttocks, to stay there. As if the adults walking past him did not all crawl, once\u2019. Ifeoma\u2019s statement broadens the novel from a previously personal perspective to a reflection of the international Western military and economic control. Where the reader has seen characters throughout the novel fight for their cognitive autonomy, here, Adichie urges Nigeria and other African countries to do the same. She uses this metaphor to effectively convey the illogic of the Western belief that Nigeria cannot rule itself. In this way, there is an underlying sense of optimism to the novel\u2019s ending despite its otherwise melancholic tone. Whilst I would argue that \u2018Purple Hibiscus\u2019 does not have a conventionally \u2018happy ending\u2019, beneath the surface Adichie does offer a sense of hope and new beginnings. However, this is just one reader\u2019s opinion! I encourage you to read this novel and decide for yourself."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:i}={...(0,n.R)(),...e.components};return i?(0,o.jsx)(i,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,i,t)=>{t.d(i,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var a=t(6540);const o={},n=a.createContext(o);function s(e){const i=a.useContext(n);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(i):{...i,...e}}),[i,e])}function r(e){let i;return i=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:s(e.components),a.createElement(n.Provider,{value:i},e.children)}}}]);
