One of my absolute favourite books is written by Kazuo Ishiguro, \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019, and I read \u2018The Remains of the Day\u2019 in the hope that I would be left wishing to turn back the pages as I was with Ishiguro\u2019s other novel."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"That being said, it was not so bad to the point where I did not wish to put it down and start another book. I truly wished to understand it, and, having finished it I can see why it is a highly regarded novel. The protagonist, a 1950s butler named Mr Stevens, has spent his life maintaining order and serving his employer to the best of his ability. Yet this all changed with the arrival of Miss Kenton, the new housekeeper. As the book progresses, Mr Stevens\u2019 unacknowledged love for Miss Kenton becomes apparent as the story delves into one of its most central themes: regret. Alongside Stevens\u2019 regret for not sharing how he felt about Miss Kenton in his past, the reader also sees the protagonist\u2019s regret at misplaced loyalty as the true nature of his beloved employer surfaces."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Moreover, Ishiguro\u2019s moments of comedy should not be overlooked. One motif that particularly stood out to me was Stevens\u2019 inability to decipher banter nor engage with it himself. There is an excellent passage in which Stevens reflects on how his inability to joke with the new owner of Darlington Hall will, in his eyes, have negative consequences on his competence as a butler. This did lead me to question whether Stevens\u2019 lack of understanding of social cues, love of planning and order and his fixation on being the best butler he can be perhaps allude to autistic characteristics.
