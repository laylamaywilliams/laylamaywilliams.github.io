Arguably, she uses this as a metaphor for the abundance of choices people can experience in life and how this can often lead to overwhelm. I think what Plath is trying to suggest is that the combination of ambition and a lack of direction can often lead to feelings of helplessness and anxiety. As a character who has worked relentlessly all of her life, Esther consequently suffers from having to choose between a number of \u2018wonderful future[s]\u2019 but is incapable of choosing just one \u2018fig\u2019. After some research, I discovered that \u2018the green fig tree\u2019 is possibly an allusion to a biblical story. In this story, Jesus and his disciples come across a fig tree that had many green leaves. However, upon drawing closer, the tree only had leaves and no fruit. Perhaps this suggests that, deep down, the character of Esther knows that none of these future possibilities will be fulfilled. Consequently, Esther\u2019s fear of making the right decision overrides a fear of not making a decision at all, leaving her stranded and \u2018starving to death\u2019."}),"\n",(0,l.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What I loved most about \u2018The Bell Jar\u2019 was Plath\u2019s prose style. She uses rich figurative language and her writing is full of expertly crafted metaphors. This is ultimately what makes the novel engaging, sorrowful and cathartic. Although it is a difficult read, I was immersed in the world Plath creates and hence, I would give it five stars.
