Despite his desperate attempts to fit in and behave like a \u2018real boy\u2019, his homosexuality is apparent leading to bullying and his own insecurity. His mother, Agnes, is an alcoholic, abandoned by almost everyone in her life, from her husband to her eldest children. Yet, Shuggie withstands her temperamental personality and unreliable mothering attributes, despite his own happiness and security. It is a story of loss, hardship and the acceptance of one\u2019s identity. It is a story of a young boy that is forced to grow up too quickly. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was perhaps one of the most perceptive portrayals of alcoholism I have ever seen in literature. Throughout the novel, Stuart evokes both sympathy and anger from the reader towards the despairing state of Shuggie\u2019s life. The reader may hold their breath in hope that Agnes\u2019 situation will improve whilst constantly knowing that her life is ultimately hopeless. Stuart conveys the relentless ups and downs as Agnes fights for sobriety and as Shuggie watches helplessly. Whilst the novel is primarily aimed at those who can relate to the characters, particularly in terms of the key themes of addiction, poverty and sexuality, the book is still relevant to anyone willing to widen their breadth of reading and understand the hardships faced by many. The novel is, in part, autobiographical, and I think that really comes across in the insightful portrayal of 1980s poverty. It is beautifully written and carefully captures the essence of one individual\u2019s life. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my favourite moments was the protagonist\u2019s description of his mother and how \u2018when her belly was empty and her weans were hungry, she did her hair and let the world think otherwise\u2019. This is one of the few examples in the novel where Agnes did right by Shuggie. I think the admiring tone created conveys the idea that it only takes small, infrequent positive moments to reinforce one\'s love for their family. It is also a reminder to any reader to take pride in oneself and keep their head held high. In a way, this small moment of support has an undertone of melancholy as Shuggie sees his mother\u2019s love for him but knows that once she begins to drift into a drunken state, she will no longer be her proud self. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI would easily recommend this book and therefore give it four stars. I cannot wait to read Stuart\u2019s most recent book \u2018Young Mungo\u2019."},{"id":"warhorse","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/warhorse","source":"@site/blog/warhorse.mdx","title":"War Horse, National Theatre","description":"<img","date":"2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Classics","permalink":"/blog/tags/classics","description":"Classic Literature"},{"inline":true,"label":"Theatre","permalink":"/blog/tags/theatre"}],"readingTime":2.79,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Layla Williams","title":"Student, Chipping Norton School","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/layla-williams-9a6233316/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQEjUJSH3AkZqA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1722066225283?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=996Ir-euh326FsLd7gYHwWjjkie56E6U4jK8QSb77-4","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/layla"},"key":"layla"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"warhorse","title":"War Horse, National Theatre","authors":["layla"],"date":"2025-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Classics","Theatre"],"cover_image":"https://greatleapforward.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/War-Horse.jpg","rating":5},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Shuggie Bain, Douglas Stuart","permalink":"/blog/shuggie"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath","permalink":"/blog/belljar"}},"content":"<img\\r\\n  src={frontMatter.cover_image}\\r\\n  alt=\\"War Horse\\"\\r\\n  style={{\\r\\n    float: \'left\',       \\r\\n    marginRight: \'20px\', \\r\\n    marginBottom: \'10px\', \\r\\n    maxWidth: \'150px\',   \\r\\n    height: \'auto\',      \\r\\n  }}\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 11th of June 2025, I saw the National Theatre\u2019s \u2018War Horse\u2019 for the second time. Adapted for the stage by Nick Strafford, \u2018War Horse\u2019 is a compelling story of a boy\u2019s love for his horse set against the devastating backdrop of World War One. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat makes \u2018War Horse\u2019 a play unlike any other, is their spectacular use of puppetry. Designed by the Handspring Puppet Company, Joey and Topthorn, the leading horses, come alive on stage. This is, in large, due to the incredible actors in control of the puppets. Each horse is controlled by a group of three actors who work together to create the horse\u2019s character. The detail and concentration that goes into controlling these horses is unimaginable. From the changes in breath to the subtle stamp of a hoof or flick of a tail, the horses become alive in every way. I frequently had to remind myself that they were not real horses! Another way in which the puppets become alive is through the actors\' interactions with them, both puppeteers and characters. By simply looking at the puppet, the actor commandeering the head of the horse drew the audience\u2019s attention to the horses encouraging them to focus on the animal rather than the actor. Furthermore, the character\u2019s interactions with the horses evoke a range of emotions from the audience depending on their relationship with the horse. Consequently, \u2018War Horse\u2019 is an original, immersive experience that I would see time and time again. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fixed set of \u2018War Horse\u2019 consists of a projection screen designed to look like a torn piece of parchment. Throughout the play, this screen is used to project both heart-warming and heart-breaking images. For instance, when the audience sees Albert\u2019s and Joey\u2019s relationship begin to flourish, time is made prominent through the sketches of the passing seasons. This alongside the singer\u2019s incredible voice and the emotive music creates a beautiful, aesthetically appealing scene. Another use of projection that stood out to me was a moment in which blood turned into poppies after the death of many of Albert\u2019s squad in Act Two. This imaginative reminder of those lost to the war brought tears to the eyes of all those watching. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUndeniably, the show would not be what it is without the incredible backstage crew. Having been lucky enough to gain insight to what goes on backstage, I was made aware of the fast-paced, precise happenings that ensure each performance is at its best. The process of props being taken from and handed to the actors at the moments required was methodical and rapid. Watching the play from beneath the stage with the follow-spot crew or from behind the curtains with the stage manager heightened my appreciation for the show as a whole. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would not be fair to write this review without mentioning the remarkable cast. This talented group of people are what make \u2018War Horse\u2019 a magical and unique performance. They are the force that immerse the audience into the world of Albert and Joey, take us back to the early 20th century and create a truly breathtaking experience. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Theatre\u2019s \u2018War Horse\u2019 is certainly a five star show. I cannot wait to see it again."},{"id":"belljar","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/belljar","source":"@site/blog/belljar.mdx","title":"The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath","description":"<img","date":"2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Classics","permalink":"/blog/tags/classics","description":"Classic Literature"},{"inline":false,"label":"Fiction","permalink":"/blog/tags/fiction","description":"Fictional Literature"},{"inline":false,"label":"Feminism","permalink":"/blog/tags/feminism"},{"inline":false,"label":"Mental Health","permalink":"/blog/tags/mental-health"},{"inline":false,"label":"Psychology","permalink":"/blog/tags/psychology"},{"inline":false,"label":"Poetry","permalink":"/blog/tags/poetry"}],"readingTime":1.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Layla Williams","title":"Student, Chipping Norton School","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/layla-williams-9a6233316/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQEjUJSH3AkZqA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1722066225283?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=996Ir-euh326FsLd7gYHwWjjkie56E6U4jK8QSb77-4","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/layla"},"key":"layla"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"belljar","title":"The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath","authors":["layla"],"date":"2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["Classics","Fiction","Feminism","Mental Health","Psychology","Poetry"],"cover_image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812nGlXCWwL.jpg","rating":5},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"War Horse, National Theatre","permalink":"/blog/warhorse"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Catcher in the Rye, J.D Salinger","permalink":"/blog/catcher"}},"content":"<img\\r\\n  src={frontMatter.cover_image}\\r\\n  alt=\\"Book Cover: The Belljar\\"\\r\\n  style={{\\r\\n    float: \'left\',       \\r\\n    marginRight: \'20px\', \\r\\n    marginBottom: \'10px\', \\r\\n    maxWidth: \'150px\',   \\r\\n    height: \'auto\',      \\r\\n  }}\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten just months before her suicide, Plath\u2019s \u2018The Bell Jar\u2019 tells the story of ambitious student Esther Greenwood as her dreams of becoming a poet are put on hold due to a mental health crisis. Plath\u2019s writing is clear, impactful and full of heart wrenching experiences. Plath entwines ambition, dissociation between mind and body and womanhood to create a compelling tale of real experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my favourite moments of the novel is Plath\u2019s description of the fig tree. Arguably, she uses this as a metaphor for the abundance of choices people can experience in life and how this can often lead to overwhelm. I think what Plath is trying to suggest is that the combination of ambition and a lack of direction can often lead to feelings of helplessness and anxiety. As a character who has worked relentlessly all of her life, Esther consequently suffers from having to choose between a number of \u2018wonderful future[s]\u2019 but is incapable of choosing just one \u2018fig\u2019. After some research, I discovered that \u2018the green fig tree\u2019 is possibly an allusion to a biblical story. In this story, Jesus and his disciples come across a fig tree that had many green leaves. However, upon drawing closer, the tree only had leaves and no fruit. Perhaps this suggests that, deep down, the character of Esther knows that none of these future possibilities will be fulfilled. Consequently, Esther\u2019s fear of making the right decision overrides a fear of not making a decision at all, leaving her stranded and \u2018starving to death\u2019.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I loved most about \u2018The Bell Jar\u2019 was Plath\u2019s prose style. She uses rich figurative language and her writing is full of expertly crafted metaphors. This is ultimately what makes the novel engaging, sorrowful and cathartic. Although it is a difficult read, I was immersed in the world Plath creates and hence, I would give it five stars. Everyone should read this."},{"id":"catcher","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/catcher","source":"@site/blog/catcher.mdx","title":"The Catcher in the Rye, J.D Salinger","description":"<img","date":"2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"book review","permalink":"/blog/tags/book-review"},{"inline":true,"label":"dystopian","permalink":"/blog/tags/dystopian"}],"readingTime":3.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Layla Williams","title":"Student, Chipping Norton School","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/layla-williams-9a6233316/","imageURL":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQEjUJSH3AkZqA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1722066225283?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=996Ir-euh326FsLd7gYHwWjjkie56E6U4jK8QSb77-4","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/layla"},"key":"layla"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"catcher","title":"The Catcher in the Rye, J.D Salinger","authors":["layla"],"date":"2025-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["book review","dystopian"],"cover_image":"https://abc.nl/covers/9780316769488/200","rating":3},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath","permalink":"/blog/belljar"}},"content":"<img\\r\\n  src={frontMatter.cover_image}\\r\\n  alt=\\"Book Cover: The Catcher in the Rye\\"\\r\\n  style={{\\r\\n    float: \'left\',       \\r\\n    marginRight: \'20px\', \\r\\n    marginBottom: \'10px\', \\r\\n    maxWidth: \'150px\',   \\r\\n    height: \'auto\',      \\r\\n  }}\\r\\n/>\\r\\n\\r\\nJ.D Salinger\'s \'The Catcher in the Rye\' covers a timeline of just over two days and follows the journey of a teenage boy, expelled from boarding school, as he makes his way home. Throughout the novella, we see his interactions with various characters, both the \'phonies\' and those he loves. Whilst it is largely considered a modern classic, the mixed reviews came as a shock to me. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nMany believe that the protagonist, Holden, is a selfish, spoilt malcontent and that the novella\'s language is limited. Personally, I would argue that the language in the novel is chosen carefully to enhance the character voice and give the reader a true insight to the mind of a troubled teen. As for Holden himself, whilst I\'ll admit he is not the most likeable, his hardships in life, such as losing his brother at just thirteen, should not be ignored. I think that people are often inadvertently dismissive of the character\'s that they do not immediately relate to or those that are flawed. However, this should not be a cause for coming to the conclusion that the novella is poorly written. I believe that Salinger carefully captures the imperfect workings of Holden\'s mind creating a slow, but ultimately heart-warming story. \\r\\n\\r\\nHolden should be a sympathetic character. He alienates himself from his peers and views the majority of adults in his life as \'phony\'. Whilst his attitude is evidently judgemental, arguably, it is the character\'s way of avoiding failure or emotional pain. Another way in which Salinger portrays Holden as a sympathetic is through his repetitive allusions to suicide. By writing these comments in a casual way, Salinger explores the fine line between teenage angst and serious depression. For me and likely many other readers, Holden\'s dissatisfaction with life is initially difficult to comprehend; he comes from a wealthy family, has a loving sister and has every opportunity within his reach. Yet, as the story proceeds, the depth of Holden\'s unhappiness becomes apparent as his emotions become evidently more troubling than those of the average adolescent. Maybe, it is not a matter of \'why\' the character should feel this way, but rather a reflection of those emotions in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favourite parts of his story are those depicted with his younger sister, Phoebe. It is because of his perceptive sister that Holden eventually begins to take responsibility for his life and actions towards the end of the novel. I also believe that these interactions remind us, as readers that, despite Holden\'s tough facade, he is still just a child. His misinterpretation of Robert Burns\' \'Comin\' Thro the Rye\' perhaps acts as a metaphor for Holden\'s discomfort with growing up and reaching adulthood, further conveying his childish nature. I think it is interesting that Salinger chose to use this poem since its predominant theme is the question of whether or not casual sex is okay. One could interpret that this decision links to the protagonist\'s internal struggle surrounding sex and women. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for those who think the novella is lacking in plot, I believe they are missing the point. It is not meant to be an action packed story. I would interpret that Salinger aimed to highlight the importance of both friends, family and strangers in shaping an individuals life. Each character Holden meets, even in this short period of time, influences the decisions he makes and eventually, as mentioned before, his decision to work out what he wants to do with his life. This idea actually made me think of \'Station Eleven\' by Emily St. John Mandel when one of the characters reflects, moments before her death, on how different life would be if a single person, even a stranger, was not in it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I would give this book three stars. Whilst there is depth to the novella and its protagonist, personally, it wasn\'t my favourite modern classic. I can see its literary value but I simply did not enjoy it enough to give it five stars. That being said, I would still encourage you to read it if you haven\'t already and to let me know what you thought!"}]}}')}}]);
