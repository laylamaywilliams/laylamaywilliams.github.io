Designed by the Handspring Puppet Company, Joey and Topthorn, the leading horses, come alive on stage. This is, in large, due to the incredible actors in control of the puppets. Each horse is controlled by a group of three actors who work together to create the horse\u2019s character. The detail and concentration that goes into controlling these horses is unimaginable. From the changes in breath to the subtle stamp of a hoof or flick of a tail, the horses become alive in every way. I frequently had to remind myself that they were not real horses! Another way in which the puppets become alive is through the actors' interactions with them, both puppeteers and characters. By simply looking at the puppet, the actor commandeering the head of the horse drew the audience\u2019s attention to the horses encouraging them to focus on the animal rather than the actor. Furthermore, the character\u2019s interactions with the horses evoke a range of emotions from the audience depending on their relationship with the horse. Consequently, \u2018War Horse\u2019 is an original, immersive experience that I would see time and time again."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The fixed set of \u2018War Horse\u2019 consists of a projection screen designed to look like a torn piece of parchment. Throughout the play, this screen is used to project both heart-warming and heart-breaking images. For instance, when the audience sees Albert\u2019s and Joey\u2019s relationship begin to flourish, time is made prominent through the sketches of the passing seasons. This alongside the singer\u2019s incredible voice and the emotive music creates a beautiful, aesthetically appealing scene. Another use of projection that stood out to me was a moment in which blood turned into poppies after the death of many of Albert\u2019s squad in Act Two. This imaginative reminder of those lost to the war brought tears to the eyes of all those watching."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Undeniably, the show would not be what it is without the incredible backstage crew. Having been lucky enough to gain insight to what goes on backstage, I was made aware of the fast-paced, precise happenings that ensure each performance is at its best. The process of props being taken from and handed to the actors at the moments required was methodical and rapid. Watching the play from beneath the stage with the follow-spot crew or from behind the curtains with the stage manager heightened my appreciation for the show as a whole."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It would not be fair to write this review without mentioning the remarkable cast. This talented group of people are what make \u2018War Horse\u2019 a magical and unique performance.
