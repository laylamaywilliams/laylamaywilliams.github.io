Meanwhile, the protagonist, astrophysicist Joan, tries to bring the team home safely back down to earth.\r\nIf this is not enough to hook you, Jenkins-Reid brings the novel back seven years ago when the team, whom you will soon know and love, first meet. Flicking between Vanessa\u2019s and Joan\u2019s gradual love story and the climactic moments of the team in space, Jenkins-Reid creates an original, heart-breaking love story that is not one to miss. Jenkins-Reid\u2019s characters are, for the most part, complex, intriguing and well-developed. However, I would argue that she fails to develop some of the side characters, using them more as plot devices than characters in their own rights. Whilst this is typically okay, it may have been nice to see how others are affected by their experiences at NASA rather than just seeing them on surface level."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Furthermore, after having recently read Samantha Harvey\u2019s \u2018Orbital\u2019, a beautiful novella that demands reflection from its reader, I was disappointed by Jenkins-Reid\u2019s descriptions of space. Whilst it was clear that she had done her research around constellations and their origins, I believe she failed to grasp the true beauty and vastness of the, well, atmosphere! This opinion, however, may be slightly biased as I was unable not to compare these two novels. Therefore, since I would happily read any of Jenkins-Reid\u2019s novels whilst lying peacefully on the beach, I will give her latest novel 3.5 stars."})]})}function m(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var n=a(6540);const i={},o=n.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(o);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),n.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
